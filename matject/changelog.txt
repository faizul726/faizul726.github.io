Released on: May 15, 2025

[IMPORTANT NOTE]
Matject Settings is heavily reworked in this update. So, your current settings won't be available after update and you will have to set settings again.
You can take a screenshot of current settings so it's easier for you to set everything again.
If you haven't used Matject Settings then this doesn't matter.

*** Also you may run into some issues
*** In that case you ask for help in Bedrock Graphics Discord server [make sure to send message in #matject channel]
