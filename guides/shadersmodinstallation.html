    <br>
    1. Download shadermod library from <a href="https://github.com/GameParrot/mcpelauncher-shadersmod/releases/latest">mcpelauncher-shadersmod releases</a>.<br>
    2. Make sure to match arch for apk that you use in the launcher. For example, <code>x86_64</code>.<br>
    3. Extract the zip.<br>
    4. Open up your mcpelauncher folder. In Linux it would be <code>/home/username/.local/share/mcpelauncher</code> (Alternatively, you can open data folder from the launcher)<br>
    5. Make a new folder named <code>mods</code> and move the newly extracted .so file there.<br>
    6. In <code>/home/username/.local/share/mcpelauncher</code> make another folder named <code>shaders</code> and put all the shader <b>material.bin</b> files there. (You can get those from shader.mcpack /renderer/materials)<br>
    7. Now opening Minecraft from the launcher should load shaders succesfully. (Make sure you're using 1.20.80+ supported shader if you're playing newer versions than that)<br><br>

    <b>TIP:</b> Replace Linux paths as Mac if you're on Mac.<br><br>
    
    <b>How to disable the mod?</b><br>
    1. Add .bak extension to the .so file that you downloaded.<br>
    or<br>
    2. Rename the shaders folder to something else. (It doesn't disable the mod but stops the mod from loading shaders)
